ltlHelpText=About LTL Checking\n\nLTL Syntax:\n\
-use {...} for B predicates\n\
-G, F, X, U, W, R, true, false, not, &, or, and, =>\n\
 are part of the supported LTL syntax\n\
-use e(op) to check if an operation op is enabled\n\
-use sink to check if no operation is enabled that leads to another state\n\
-use brackets to check what is the next operation, e.g. [reset] => X{db={}}\n\
-Past-LTL is supported: Y, H, O, S, T are the duals to X, G, F, U, R

ltlResultIncompleteTitle=Modelchecking not completed
ltlResultIncompleteMessage=No counterexample has been found, but not all possible nodes have been visited (Due to animation parameter restrictions).
ltlResultOkTitle=Modelchecking successfully finished
ltlResultOkMessage=No counterexample has been found, all nodes have been visited.
ltlResultCounterexampleTitle=Counterexample found
ltlResultCounterexampleMessage=A counterexample has been found. It will be shown in the LTL view.
ltlResultNoStartTitle=No initialisation found
ltlResultNoStartMessage=No initialised state to start from has been found.\nProB could not initialise the machine,  maybe there is a problem with the animation settings. Try to animate the model first.

ltlLoopAdvice=\nThe counterexample contains a loop. It will be highlighted in yellow.

ltlMultiResultOkMessage=No counterexamples have been found.
ltlMultiResultCounterexampleMessage=A counterexample has been found at least for one formula. Counterexample(s) will be shown in the LTL view.
